% About me
\begin{AboutMe}
I am a Web Developer / Programmer in the Center for Academic Excellence (CAE) at Appalachian State University. My role involves developing and updating the academic web applications used on campus, including the learning management system. Before joining the CAE team, I worked with the Web Services group designing and building academic websites in the Drupal framework.\\\\
Prior to coming to work for the university in 2010, I worked for several marketing, advertising, and design companies where I developed experience with marketing and advertising strategy, branding, public relations, project management, graphic design and art direction, as well as web development. I bring knowledge about strategic communication as well as design, usability, and accessibility to the application development CAE provides for campus.\\\\
I have a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration and Marketing from the University of Baltimore, I have studied advertising at Maryland Institute College of Art, and I am currently working on a Master of Science in Computer Science at Appalachian State University. My professional interests are focused on web application design and development, and personally I enjoy rock climbing, kung fu, and crossword puzzles.
